# React + TypeScript + Vite

I previously created a Movie application: [Demo](https://sz-adam.github.io/movie-2.0-pages/) | [Code](https://github.com/sz-adam/react-movie-2.0).

This is an enhanced version of that application. The homepage displays a random selection of movies, series, and episodes. Iâ€™ve also added a search function, as well as a details page and a favorites page.

The biggest change in this version is in the routing and API management. **React-Router-Dom** is responsible for navigation and handling most API calls, and I used **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
